The websocket assignment allows very fast communication between the Photon and a webpage. 

The Particle cloud takes about 1200ms to communicate

The websocket takes about 10 ms to communicate


Problem: The websocket hacks an old version of node ws which has been deprecated. Probably would be a good idea to try to update this code to a safer version of ws.
